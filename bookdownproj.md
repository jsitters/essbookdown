# Intro
This is an R Bookdown document of the data analysis skills I have learned through ESS 580. Weekly assignments are compiled in this bookdown so I (or someone else) can use this as a template for my own research data.

## SiteDescription
The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is shown below

Some key aspects of this location are:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests




```r
q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')
```



## Static Data Plotter



```r
ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')
```

```
## Warning: Removed 31 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).

## Interactive Data Plotter



```r
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```

## Poudre Paragraph
The _Cache la Poudre_ is a snow melt fed watershed in Northern Colorado. Much of the Poudre is under limited human impact, with almost __half__ of the river designated as a [Wild and Scenic river](https://www.rivers.gov/wsr-act.php). The City of Fort Collins is concerned that [microplastics](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/microplastics.html) in freshwater environments could impact both __ecological__ and __human__ health since the Cache la Poudre River watershed is a main source of drinking and irrigation water for Northern Colorado. Utility managers are interested in finding out a way to remove microplastics through the WWTP as described in the research by [Ngo](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749119337169).

# Data Wrangle
Now that we have learned how to munge (manipulate) data and plot it, we will work on using these skills in new ways. Pulling data from files and reading them into R for analysis. 

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
```



```r
####-----Reading in Data and Stacking it ----- ####
#Reading in files
files <- list.files('data',full.names=T)
##'data' will work if not inline printing

#Read in individual data files
ndmi <- read_csv(files[1]) %>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndmi')


ndsi <- read_csv(files[2]) %>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndsi')

ndvi <- read_csv(files[3])%>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndvi')

# Stack as a tidy dataset
full_long <- rbind(ndvi,ndmi,ndsi) %>%
  gather(key='site',value='value',-DateTime,-data) %>%
  filter(!is.na(value))
##new word is called pivot_longer
```




## Question (1) 

What is the correlation between NDVI and NDMI? - here I want you to
convert the full_long dataset in to a wide dataset using the 
function "spread" and then make a plot that shows the correlation s a
function of if the site was burned or not (x axis should be ndmi)
You should exclude winter months and focus on summer months

```r
full_wide<-spread(full_long, key='data', value='value')%>%
  mutate(month=month(DateTime))%>%
  filter( month %in% c(5,6,7,8,9))

ggplot(full_wide, aes(x=ndmi, y=ndvi,color=site ))+
  geom_point(shape=1) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  #scale_color_few() + 
  theme(legend.position=c(0.8,0.8))
```

```
## Warning: Removed 19 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

<img src="02-Wrangle_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" />
"There is a positive correlation between NDMI and NDVI for the summer months. This indicates that seasonal moisture impacts vegetation growth. "

## Question (2) 

2) What is the correlation between average NDSI (normalized
 snow index) for January - April and average NDVI for June-August?
In other words, does the previous year's snow cover influence vegetation
 growth for the following summer?

```r
f_ndsi<-filter(full_long, data=='ndsi')%>%
  mutate(year=year(DateTime),month=month(DateTime))%>%
  filter(month%in% c(1,2,3,4))%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  summarise(mean_ndsi=mean(value))

f_ndvi<-filter(full_long, data=='ndvi')%>%
  mutate(year=year(DateTime),month=month(DateTime))%>%
  filter(month%in% c(7,8,9))%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  summarise(mean_ndvi=mean(value))

all_year<-inner_join(f_ndsi, f_ndvi, by='year')
  
ggplot(all_year, aes(x=mean_ndsi, y=mean_ndvi))+ 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  #scale_color_few() + 
  theme(legend.position=c(0.8,0.8)) +
  ylab("Mean NDVI") +
  xlab("Mean NDSI")
```

<img src="02-Wrangle_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" />
"There is a weak positive correlation between NSDI and NDVI. This indicates that the previous years' snow cover influences the vegetation growth."

## Question (3)

How is the snow effect from question 2 different between pre- and post-burn
and burned and unburned? 


```r
ndsi3<-filter(full_long, data=='ndsi')%>%
  mutate(year=year(DateTime),month=month(DateTime))%>%
  filter(month%in% c(1,2,3,4))%>%
  group_by(year,site)%>%
  summarise(mean_ndsi=mean(value))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

```r
ndvi3<-filter(full_long, data=='ndvi')%>%
  mutate(year=year(DateTime),month=month(DateTime))%>%
  filter(month%in% c(7,8,9))%>%
  group_by(year,site)%>%
  summarise(mean_ndvi=mean(value))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

```r
all_year3<-left_join(ndsi3, ndvi3)
```

```
## Joining, by = c("year", "site")
```

```r
ggplot(all_year3, aes(x=mean_ndsi, y=mean_ndvi, color=site))+ 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  #scale_color_few()+ 
  ylab("Mean NDVI") +
  xlab("Mean NDSI")
```

<img src="02-Wrangle_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" />
"The burned sites (blue) are more impacted by the previous years snow than the unburned (orange) sites"

## Question (4)

What month is the greenest month on average? 


```r
#plot it?
monthlygreen<-spread(full_long, key='data', value='value')%>%
  mutate(month=month(DateTime))%>%
  group_by( month)%>%
  summarise(meanNdvi=mean(ndvi, na.rm=TRUE))

ggplot(monthlygreen, aes(x=month, y=meanNdvi))+ 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("Mean NDVI")+
  scale_x_continuous(name="Month Number", limits=c(1, 12), breaks=c(2,4,6,8,10,12))
```

<img src="02-Wrangle_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />

```r
Q4<-with(monthlygreen, month[which.max(meanNdvi)])
print(Q4)
```

```
## [1] 8
```

```r
message("On average the greenest month is the ", Q4, "th month.")
```

```
## On average the greenest month is the 8th month.
```


## Question (5) 

What month is the snowiest on average?

```r
snowy<-spread(full_long, key='data', value='value')%>%
  mutate(month=month(DateTime))%>%
  group_by( month)%>%
  summarise(meanNdsi=mean(ndsi, na.rm=TRUE))

ggplot(snowy, aes(x=month, y=meanNdsi))+ 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("Mean NDSI")+
  scale_x_continuous(name="Month Number", limits=c(1, 12), breaks=c(2,4,6,8,10,12))
```

<img src="02-Wrangle_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />

```r
Q5<-with(snowy, month[which.max(meanNdsi)])
print(Q5)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
message("On average the snowiest month is the ", Q5, "st month.")
```

```
## On average the snowiest month is the 1st month.
```

```
## Loop to read in data 
Download the meteorological data. Use the `download_file` and `str_split_fixed` commands to download the data and save it in your data folder. You can use a for loop or a map function. 

```r
splits <- str_split_fixed(links,'/',8)
#Keep only the 8th column
dataset <- splits[,8] 
#generate a file list for where the data goes
file_names <- paste0('data/',dataset)
for(i in 1:2){
  download.file(links[i],destfile=file_names[i])
}
downloaded <- file.exists(file_names)
list.dirs(path='3_snow_functions_iteration/data')
```

```
## character(0)
```
## Read in Function
Write a custom function to read in the data and append a site column to the data. 


```r
# this code grabs the variable names from the metadata pdf file
library(pdftools)
```

```
## Using poppler version 22.02.0
```

```r
headers <- pdf_text('https://snowstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Serially-Complete-Metadata-text08.pdf') %>%
  readr::read_lines(.) %>%
  trimws(.) %>%
  str_split_fixed(.,'\\.',2) %>%

## Plotting data
Make a line plot of mean temp by year by site (using the `air temp [K]` variable). Is there anything suspicious in the plot? Adjust your filtering if needed.

```r
temperature<-met_files%>%
  group_by(year, site)%>%
  summarize(meanT = mean(`air temp [K]`))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

```r
ggplot(temperature, aes(x=year, y=meanT, color=site))+
  geom_line()+
  ggthemes::theme_few()+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Mean Air Temperature (K)")
```

<img src="03-Function_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />
"Site SBB_SASP has a higher yearly mean temperature than site SBB_SBSP for all years in the dataset. There is a big jump in temperature from the first year to the following years. Further inspection (in Q6) is needed to determine the suspicious jump in data."

## Function to create multiple plots
Write a function that makes line plots of monthly average temperature at each site for a given year. Use a for loop to make these plots for 2005 to 2010. Are monthly average temperatures at the Senator Beck Study Plot ever warmer than the Snow Angel Study Plot?
Hint: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/print.ggplot.html

```r

## Bonus
Make a plot of average daily precipitation by day of year (averaged across all available years). Color each site. 

```r

```
## There does not seem to be evidence of slowing yield in Winneshiek County because there is a positive quadratic relationship.
```
## Question 2 
Time Series: Let's analyze the relationship between temperature and yields for the Winneshiek County time series. Use data on yield and summer avg Tmax. Is adding year or Tmax^2 to your model helpful? Make a plot and interpret the results.

```r
q2<-inner_join(winnesummer, Winne_CY)
```

```
## Joining, by = "year"
```

```r
ggplot(q2,aes(x=meantmax, y=yield))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Mean Max Temperature (°C)", y="Corn Yield")+
  ggtitle("Temperature and Yield for Winneshiek County")
```

<img src="05-Regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />

```r
q2$tmp2<-q2$meantmax^2

## F-statistic: 5.579 on 2 and 35 DF,  p-value: 0.007887
```

```r
q2$fittedq <- lm_quad$fitted.values


ggplot(q2)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=meantmax, y=yield))+
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=meantmax, y=fittedq))+
  theme_bw()+ 
  labs(x="Mean Max Temperature (°C)", y="Corn Yield")+
  ggtitle("Trend of Temperature and Yield for Winneshiek County")
```

'Adding a model of Tmax^2 is helpful to interperte the trends of temperature and its effects on corn yield. From this graph you can see as temperature increases yield does as well until a threshold is reached and yield begins to decrease as temperature gets hotter.'

## Question 3 
Cross-Section: Analyze the relationship between temperature and yield across all counties in 2018. Is there a relationship? Interpret the results.

```r
colnames(cornyields)[1]="countyfp"
cornyields$countyfp<- as.numeric(cornyields$countyfp)
tmaxdf$countyfp<- as.numeric(tmaxdf$countyfp)

yield18<- cornyields%>%
  filter(year=='2018')
temp18<-tmaxdf%>%
  filter(year=='2018')


jd18<-inner_join(yield18, temp18, by ="countyfp")%>%
  filter(!is.na(tmax))%>%
  group_by(countyfp, yield)%>%
  summarise(meanTmax=mean(tmax))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'countyfp'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

```r
ggplot(mapping = aes(x=jd18$meanTmax, y=jd18$yield))+
  geom_point()+
  ggtitle("2018 Temperature and Yield Analysis")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Mean Max Temperature (°C)", y="Corn Yield (tons/acre)")+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
```

<img src="05-Regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />
'There does not seem to be much of a trend between temperature and corn yield over all of the counties in 2018. When a linear model if fitted to the data you can see a slight decreasing trend in temperature vs yield. '

## Question 4 
Panel: One way to leverage multiple time series is to group all data into what is called a "panel" regression. Convert the county ID code ("countyfp" or "county_ansi") into factor using as.factor, then include this variable in a regression using all counties' yield and summer temperature data. How does the significance of your temperature coefficients (Tmax, Tmax^2) change? Make a plot comparing actual and fitted yields and interpret the results of your model.

```r
summer <- tmaxdf %>%
  filter(doy >= 152 & doy <= 243) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(meantmax = mean(tmax))

cornyields$year <- as.numeric(cornyields$year)

combo<- inner_join(cornyields, summer, by='year')
combo$fac<- as.factor(combo$countyfp)
combo$temp2<-combo$meantmax^2
lm_combo<-lm(yield~meantmax+temp2+year+fac, combo)
summary(lm_combo)
```

```

'The model fits yield based on multiple variables including mean max temp, temperature squared, each county, and each year. The coefficients for temperature is positive but the coefficient for temp^2 is negative. The graph shows how well the modeled predicts values for yield, it is not quite a one to one relationship but there is a linear trend.'

## Question 5
Soybeans: Download NASS data on soybean yields and explore either a time series relationship for a given county, the cross-sectional relationship for a given year, or a panel across all counties and years.

'There is a steady increase in soybean yield over time in the Buena Vista county.'

# Machine Learning
Using machine learning to fine tune a model to get the lowest error. 



A friend told me today about a term called ["Grad student descent"](https://sciencedryad.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/grad-student-descent/) which is a 
play on words with the term gradient descent, an extremely common tool used to 
tune hyperparameters (and parameters) for machine learning models. Grad student
descent then is when that method is simply having grad students search a parameter
space manually in part to improve the model, and in part to learn how these
algorithms work.

Today we are trying to predict the concentrations of either chlorophyll a (`CHLA`) 
or total suspended sediment (`TSS`) in the Loire River France using satellite imagery.
The grab sample data (someone grabbing water from a stream for analysis), comes
from the French electricity agency who collects this data to meet their water
quality standards. 
Basically the core idea here is that water color as captured in an image tells you
something about what is in the water. If it's green and bright (lots of light 
reflected from the water), then it may have a lot of algae (Chlorophyll a is a proxy
for algal biomass). If it's tan and bright, it may have lots of sediment. If it's
dark and blue it's clear!

This color information is captured in "bands" like red, blue, green etc... from
the Landsat series of satellites, which have collected data over the world since
the late 70s. For this analysis we are only using Landsat 5,7, and 8, so the
data goes back to 1984. 


## Model development


```r
wq_sr <- read_csv('data/wq_sr.csv') %>%
  mutate(year = year(date))
```

```
## Rows: 777 Columns: 109
## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
## Delimiter: ","
## chr    (6): site_name, geometry, LS_ID, sat, season, hexcolor
## dbl  (100): site_no, TSS, PheoP, CHLA, lat, long, split_ID, Cloud_Cover, azi...
## dttm   (1): date_time
## date   (1): date
## time   (1): time
## 
## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```





This is the fiddly bit. The goal? Tune hyperparameters to get the lowest
RMSE and the best Measured/Predicted fit (points close to the red line).
