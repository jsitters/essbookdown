# Intro
This is an R Bookdown document of the data analysis skills I have learned through ESS 580.

# R Markdown

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests



```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



## Static Data Plotter


```{r}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


## Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



## Assignment Prompt 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertise in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:

## DyGraph example 
```{r}

dygraph(q_xts) %>% 
dyRangeSelector()
``` 
## Poudre Paragraph
The _Cache la Poudre_ is a snow melt fed watershed in Northern Colorado. Much of the Poudre is under limited human impact, with almost __half__ of the river designated as a [Wild and Scenic river](https://www.rivers.gov/wsr-act.php). The City of Fort Collins is concerned that [microplastics](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/microplastics.html) in freshwater environments could impact both __ecological__ and __human__ health since the Cache la Poudre River watershed is a main source of drinking and irrigation water for Northern Colorado. Utility managers are interested in finding out a way to remove microplastics through the WWTP as described in the research by [Ngo](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749119337169).
